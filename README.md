Hue and Cry

Hue and Cry explores how we make decisions together â€” blending political theory, participatory code, and visual storytelling to question power, memory, and what it means to have a say.

The project draws inspiration from workplace democracy, the challenges of designing fair voting systems, and the principles of liquid democracy, where direct and representative voting coexist.

âœ¨ Concept

In Hue and Cry, users manipulate RGB sliders â€” each representing societal concerns â€” to generate evolving Perlin noise visuals. Every input is stored locally, emphasizing the personal weight of participation, while inactivity gradually fades the sketch to grayscale, symbolizing collective disengagement.

The result is a participatory artwork that invites reflection on agency, responsibility, and the fragile balance of democratic decision-making.
